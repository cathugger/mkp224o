mkp224o - vanity address generator for ed25519 onion services

This tool generates vanity ed25519 (hidden service version 3, formely known as proposal 224) onion addresses.
For context, see <https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/plain/rend-spec-v3.txt>.

REQUIREMENTS:
C99 compatible compiler, libsodium*, GNU make, GNU autoconf, UNIX-like platform (currently tested in Linux and OpenBSD).

*
For Debian-like: libsodium & libsodium-dev
For Red Hat: libsodium & libsodium-devel

BUILDING:
`./autogen.sh` to generate configure script, if it's not there already.
`./configure` to generate makefile; in *BSD platforms you probably want to use
`./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"`.
You probably also want to pass something like "--enable-amd64-51-30k"
or "--enable-donna" to configure script for faster key generation;
run `./configure --help` to see all available options.
Finally, `make` to start building (`gmake` in *BSD platforms).

USAGE:
Generator needs one or more filters to work.
It makes directory with secret/public keys and hostname
for each discovered service. By default root is current
directory, but that can be overridden with -d switch.
Use -s switch to enable printing of statistics, which may be useful
when benchmarking different ed25519 implementations on your machine.
Use -h switch to obtain all available options.
I highly recommend reading OPTIMISATION.txt for performance-related tips.
