mkp224o - vanity address generator for ed25519 onion services

This tool generates vanity ed25519 (hidden service version 3, formely known as proposal 224) onion addresses.
For context, see <https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/plain/rend-spec-v3.txt>.


REQUIREMENTS:

C99 compatible compiler (gcc and clang should work),
libsodium (including headers), GNU make,
GNU autoconf (to generate configure script, needed only if not using release tarball),
UNIX-like platform (currently tested in Linux and OpenBSD, but should also build under cygwin and msys2).
For debian-like linux distros, this should be enough to prepare for building:
`apt install gcc libsodium-dev make autoconf`.


BUILDING:

`./autogen.sh` to generate configure script, if it's not there already.
`./configure` to generate makefile; in *BSD platforms you probably want to use
`./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"`.
You probably also want to pass something like "--enable-amd64-51-30k"
or "--enable-donna" to configure script for faster key generation;
run `./configure --help` to see all available options.
Finally, `make` to start building (`gmake` in *BSD platforms).

USAGE:

Generator needs one or more filters to work.
It makes directory with secret/public keys and hostname
for each discovered service. By default root is current
directory, but that can be overridden with -d switch.
Use -s switch to enable printing of statistics, which may be useful
when benchmarking different ed25519 implementations on your machine.
Use -h switch to obtain all available options.
I highly recommend reading OPTIMISATION.txt for performance-related tips.


FAQ AND OTHER USEFUL INFO:

 * How do I generate address?
 - Once compiled, run it like `./mkp224o neko`, and it will try creating keys
   for onions starting with "neko" in this example; use `./mkp224o -d nekokeys neko` to
   not litter current directory and put all discovered keys in directory named "nekokeys".

 * How do I run with Docker?
 - `docker build -f Dockerfile -t mkp224o .` to build the docker image
   `docker run -it -v `pwd`:/root/ onion:latest sh`
   Now run the `mkp224o neko` command and it will create key for onion starting with "neko"
   in the current working directory.

 * How do I make tor use generated keys?
 - Copy key folder (though technically only hs_ed25519_secret_key is required)
   to where you want your service keys to reside:
   `sudo cp -r neko54as6d54....onion /var/lib/tor/nekosvc`.
   You may need to adjust owner and permissions:
   `sudo chown -R tor: /var/lib/tor/nekosvc`,
   `sudo chmod -R u+rwX,og-rwx /var/lib/tor/nekosvc`.
   Then edit torrc and add new service with that folder.
   After reload/restart tor should pick it up.

 * Generate addresses with 1-2 and 7-9 digits?
 - onion addresses use base32 encoding which does not include 1,2,7,8,9 numbers.
   so no, that's not possible to generate these, and mkp224o tries to detect invalid filters containing them early on.

 * How long is it going to take?
 - Because of probablistic nature of brute force key generation, and varience of hardware it's going to run on,
   it's hard to make promisses about how long it's going to take, especially when the most of users want just a few keys.
   See <https://github.com/cathugger/mkp224o/issues/27> for very valuable discussion about this.
   If your machine is powerful enough, 6 character prefix shouldn't take more than few tens of minutes,
   if using batch mode (read OPTIMISATION.txt). 7 characters can take hours to days.
   No promisses though, it depends on pure luck.

 * Will this work with onionbalance?
 - It appears that onionbalance supports loading usual hs_ed25519_secret_key key so it should work.
